# Pool-Database

## Description
One of the issues in management at an indoor swimming facility would be the poor performance of employee record keeping due to the lack of an effective automated database.The proposed DBMS would allow and assist management in storing employee information and performance records with ease compared to the nuisance of using folders and filing cabinets. The database will in addition allow flexible modification of records and search functions to help retrieve data on certain employees. Management will be able to use this database to sort and search for employees under specific circumstances. Examples may include: those with who have completed a skills refreshment training in January, employee(s) with more than three infractions, or those who do not have up-to-date certifications. 

## Scope
The database will store information about all employees at the pool and will describe their employment info (name, address, etc.), training and certifications achieved, hiring info, etc. Aside from storing data about the employees, the DBMS will also track required refreshment training progress, any incidents/infractions by the employees, the number of critical shift hours covered, etc.
